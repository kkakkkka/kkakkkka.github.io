Hi, I am a student at Tsinghua University. My research focus on multi-modal learning  and generative models. I have broad interests and am always open to explore new and meaningful topics.

As my tech expertise deepened, I now focus less on paper quantity and more on rethinking problems and offering simple, effective solutions.
